# PCOS-detection-using-classifiation-techniques
Detection of PCOS among women using different Classification techniques and also some ensemble techniques 


Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) has become as common as common cold these days in women
aging towards puberty.The objective of our model is to identify the best machine learning model to predict PCOS among
women. These will be potentially useful in clinical practice as an early screening in women with PCOS.
The aim of our project is to:
 Analysis of various machine learning algorithms in predicting PCOS by comparing the
accuracy of each model
 Detecting the circumstances that are most likely to cause PCOS.


Classification techniques are applied to two given dataset : dataset1 and dataset2
Best performing classification techniques are ->Decision Tree Classifier,Logistic Regression,KNN.
Ensemble learning was then applied using above classification techniques, applied ensemble techniques are-> Random Forest, Stacking, Bagging meta-estimator, AdaBoost
